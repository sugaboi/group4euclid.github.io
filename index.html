				<h1 class="heading">What is SLEEP?</h1>
				<p style="text-indent: 20px;"><b><i>Sleep</i></b> is a condition of body and mind such as that which typically recurs for several hours every night, in which the nervous system is relatively inactive, the eyes closed, the postural muscles relaxed, and consciousness practically suspended. Your behaviors during the day, and especially before bedtime, can have a major impact on your sleep. They can promote healthy sleep or contribute to sleeplessness. The term <b><i>"sleep hygiene"</i></b> refers to a series of healthy sleep habits that can improve your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. If you have difficulty in sleeping or want to improve your sleep, try following these healhty sleep habits. <a href="tips.html" style="text-decoration: none;">(click here)</a></p>

					<h3>Effects of Sleep Deprivation</h3>
					<p>If you’ve ever spent a night tossing and turning, you already know how you’ll feel the next day — tired, cranky, and out of sorts. But missing out on the recommended 7 to 9 hours of shut-eye nightly does more than make you feel groggy and grumpy. The long term effects of sleep deprivation are real. It drains your mental abilities and puts your physical health at real risk. Science has linked poor slumber with all kinds of health problems, from weight gain to a weakened immune system.

					Your body needs sleep, just as it needs air and food to function at its best. During sleep, your body heals itself and restores its chemical balance. Your brain forges new connections and helps memory retention. Without enough sleep, your brain and body systems won’t function normally. It can also dramatically lower your quality of life. A review of 16 studies found that sleeping for less than 6 to 8 hours a night increases the risk of early death by about 12 percent. </p>
